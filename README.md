# HelloComputer

For this weeks assignment, I wanted to try out using an element and allow it to function and speak over an action (for example a mouseover).  

Initially I wanted to use the gif presented above, however, due to limited time, I decided to just use an image instead. The function of the code itself is rather straight forward, I used a onmouseover in Javascript and call for a sound synthesis when the mouse is over the image.
